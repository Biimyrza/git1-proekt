		Text messaging, or texting, is the act of be sent over a cellular
		 network, or may also be sent via an Internet connection.mof essages,

       The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message
        Service (SMS). It has grown beyond alphanumeric text  Messaging Service (MMS)
          containing digital images, videos, and sound content, 
        as well as  known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and 
         instant messenger applications (usually the term is used when on mobile devices).

         Text messages are used for personal, family, business and social purposes.
          Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for 
          communication between colleagues. In the 2010s, the sending of short informal
           messages became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with 
           emailing.[1] This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends,
            family and colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or
           inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the other person 
           is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and voicemail and unlike calls
            (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not
             require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits 
             communication even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact 
             with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites,
              or to participate in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing
               to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates, and other 
               notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.
